# BFA_population_v1_0_methods
This repository aims at explaining the code developped to produce the Burkina Faso 2019 gridded population estimates [link when published].

In October 2020, the Institut National de la Statistique et de la DÃ©mographie - INSD - released its provisional census population counts for every *communes,* that is the Burkinabe administrative unit level 3.

To disaggregate those totals into high-resolution gridded estimates for greater flexibility in computing population count for custom spatial units, we adapted the dasymetric mapping explained in [Stevens (2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0107042) using the openly accessible scripts written by [Bondarenko (2018)](https://www.worldpop.org/wprfpms).
